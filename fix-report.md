# Wallet Node Interaction Fix Report

## Issues Fixed

1. **Sound Path Correction**
   - Changed sound file paths to work with the correct deployment structure
   - Paths now reference the files directly without directory prefixes

2. **Core Orb Interaction Prevention**
   - Enhanced the check to properly exclude the center orb from interaction
   - Added additional safety checks for null wallet data

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Made the "Press E" prompt more visible with increased size and a glow effect
   - Positioned the prompt to avoid tooltip overlap
   - Added subtle UI sound effects for confirmation and cancellation actions

4. **Interaction Flow Enhancement**
   - Improved keyboard event handling with preventDefault() to avoid page scrolling
   - Added more verbose console logging for easier debugging
   - Fixed the prompt reappearance after closing the confirmation dialog

5. **Confirmation Dialog Formatting**
   - Updated the dialog content to match the exact required format
   - Improved visual styling for better readability

## Additional Robustness Improvements

1. **Error Handling**
   - Added explicit error handling for sound playback failures
   - Added checks to prevent interaction with invalid wallet data

2. **Performance**
   - Embedded UI sounds as data URIs to eliminate network requests
   - Streamlined event handling to reduce unnecessary operations

All changes have been tested and pushed to the GitHub repository, and should now be reflected in the Vercel deployment.
