# Black Screen Issue Fix Report

## Problem

The wallet visualization application was displaying only a black screen when deployed to Vercel. The issue was preventing any visualization of the wallet nodes.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, the following issues were identified:

1. **Module Import Error**: The application was using bare module specifiers in imports (e.g., `import { EffectComposer } from 'three/examples/jsm/postprocessing/EffectComposer.js'`), which weren't properly resolved in the Vercel environment.

2. **Controls Initialization Error**: There was an error initializing the `FlyControls` which was causing the rendering loop to fail.

3. **Missing Error Handling**: The application had insufficient error handling around critical rendering functions, causing silent failures.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Direct Library Loading**: Replaced ES module imports with direct script loading via CDN:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/0.150.1/three.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.150.1/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Controls Simplification**: Replaced the problematic `FlyControls` with more reliable `OrbitControls`, including proper error handling for controls initialization.

3. **Robust Error Handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around critical rendering functionality to prevent complete application failure when individual components fail.

4. **Debug Logging**: Implemented a visual debug panel to display initialization steps and any errors that occur, making it easier to diagnose issues in the deployed environment.

5. **Testing Environment**: Created a simplified testing environment with only essential components to verify the basic rendering functionality.

## Implementation Details

1. The new implementation includes:
   - Simplified HTML structure with direct script loading
   - Robust error handling throughout the rendering pipeline
   - Visual debug logging on screen
   - Fallback mechanisms for when certain features fail

2. Removed complex postprocessing effects temporarily to focus on ensuring basic rendering works.

3. Created test spheres to represent Fartcoin and Goattoken wallets to verify the basic functionality.

## Verification

1. Confirmed the rendering works locally with the simplified implementation.
2. Pushed to GitHub repository.
3. Verified the fix is deployed to Vercel at https://ssss-rouge-chi.vercel.app/

## Next Steps

1. Now that the basic rendering is working, the interactive tooltip features can be restored.
2. Sound effects and interaction functionality can be re-implemented on top of this stable base.
3. Gradually re-introduce more complex visual effects once the basic functionality is stable.

## Lessons Learned

1. Always test deployments in an environment similar to the production environment.
2. Implement proper error handling and fallbacks for critical rendering components.
3. Provide a visual debugging mechanism for web-based visualizations to make issues easier to diagnose.
4. Consider compatibility issues with module loading when using advanced ES module features.
