Fractal Wallet Visualization: Galaxy Expansion
================================================
Date: July 10, 2025

IMPLEMENTED CHANGES:

1. EXPANSION:
   - Expanded fractal node placement by a factor of 20
   - Applied consistent scaling to maintain proportional structure
   - Increased node sizes for better visibility in the larger space
   - Created flatteningFactor to make structure more galaxy-like

2. SWIRLING GALAXY VIEW:
   - Implemented galaxy container for unified rotation
   - Added continuous slow rotation to simulate galaxy swirl
   - Created auto-rotation feature that activates after 10 seconds of inactivity
   - Set initial camera position for full galaxy overview

3. STAR FIELD ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Expanded star field to 30,000 background stars
   - Added medium brightness layer for more depth
   - Increased star sizes for better visibility
   - Extended distribution range to match expanded fractal scale

4. IMPROVED CONTROLS:
   - Increased movement speed to handle larger scale
   - Extended camera frustum to render distant objects
   - Maintained existing interaction scheme (WASD movement, mouse look)

5. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
   - Reduced geometry complexity for improved rendering with large node count
   - Implemented frustum culling to maintain performance
   - Organized nodes under a single container for better memory management

VERIFIED FEATURES:
- Fractal layout maintains original shape but at 20x scale
- Camera positioned to view entire structure at start
- Structure rotates slowly for cinematic effect
- Color-coding maintained (purple for Fartcoin, orange for Goattoken)
- Node hover tooltips work correctly
- All 2,000 wallet nodes visible in galaxy formation

The visualization now resembles a realistic galaxy with a sprawling, massive structure that users can fly through. The entire structure is visible from the initial camera position and slowly rotates for a more immersive, cinematic experience.
