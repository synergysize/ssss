## Render Errors Log

The following errors were observed in the browser console:

1. Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at file:///home/computeruse/.anthropic/sss3/public/src/main.js. (Reason: CORS request not http).

2. Module source URI is not allowed in this document: "file:///home/computeruse/.anthropic/sss3/public/src/main.js". Index.html:138

3. Downloadable font: download failed (font-family: "Digital" style:normal weight:400 stretch:100 src index:0): status=2147746065 source: https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/s/29068/digital-7.woff

These errors indicate that the JavaScript module cannot be loaded properly due to CORS restrictions when using file:// protocol. The Three.js canvas is not being rendered because the main.js module could not be executed.
