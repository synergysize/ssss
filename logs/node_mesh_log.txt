======== NODE MESH CONNECTION LOG ========
Date: 2025-07-10

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
- Successfully implemented node connections between wallets of the same type
- Created separate connection meshes for Fartcoin and Goattoken nodes
- Added animated transaction pulses with fade-in/fade-out effects
- Optimized performance with buffer geometry and limited connections per node

CONFIGURATION:
- Base connection opacity: 0.03
- Pulse duration: 0.5 seconds
- Pulse interval: 300-500ms (randomized)
- Maximum active pulses: 50
- Connection colors: 
  * Fartcoin: 0x8A2BE2 (Purple)
  * Goattoken: 0xFFA500 (Orange)
- Pulse colors:
  * Fartcoin: 0xB866FF (Bright Purple)
  * Goattoken: 0xFFB347 (Bright Orange)

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
1. Dynamic connection density based on node count:
   - Large node sets (>500): 3 connections per node
   - Medium node sets (100-500): 5-10 connections per node
   - Small node sets (<100): ~1/3 of nodes connected

2. Performance techniques:
   - Single buffer geometry for all connections of each type
   - Additive blending for improved visual effect
   - Transparent materials with low opacity
   - Separate container for pulse lines
   - Automatic cleanup of expired pulse animations

VISUAL EFFECT:
- Created a chaotic, glowing web appearance
- Random transaction pulses create a sense of activity
- Connection opacity low enough to prevent visual clutter
- Maintains smooth camera movement and navigation

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Could implement custom shaders for more efficient pulse animations
- Add variable line thickness based on transaction volume
- Implement data-driven connections based on actual blockchain transactions
- Add options to toggle connection visibility
