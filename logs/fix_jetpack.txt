Jetpack Boost Functionality Fix

Issue:
- Jetpack boost was not properly applying movement to the camera
- Movement calculation was ineffective for boosting the player

Changes Made:
1. Modified jetpack boost code to directly modify camera position
2. Doubled the boost multiplier for more noticeable jetpack effect
3. Added upward vector component for better flying feel
4. Added visual feedback for jetpack activation
5. Enhanced logging for better debugging

Now users can:
- Hold Left Shift to activate the jetpack
- Experience significant forward thrust in the camera's direction
- See visual feedback when the jetpack is active
- Monitor fuel consumption while using the jetpack

The jetpack boost functionality is now fully operational, allowing players to quickly traverse the visualization space.
