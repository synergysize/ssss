LOCAL NODE MESH CONNECTION SUMMARY
============================================
Date: 2025-07-10

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
----------------------
- Each wallet node connects only to its 3-6 nearest neighbors of the same type
- Fartcoin (purple) nodes only connect to other purple nodes
- Goattoken (orange) nodes only connect to other orange nodes
- Connections use a distance-based algorithm for local clustering
- Mesh lines are thin and semi-transparent (opacity: 0.03)
- Connection count reduced by ~50% compared to previous implementation
- Each connection can dynamically highlight with animated pulses

CONNECTION STATISTICS:
--------------------
Total nodes: 2000
- Fartcoin nodes: 1000
- Goattoken nodes: 1000

Connection count:
- Total connections: ~4000-6000 (varies per run due to random elements)
- Average connections per node: ~3-4
- Maximum distance between connected nodes: varies based on dataset

ANIMATION FEATURES:
-----------------
- Random connections pulse to simulate transactions
- When a connection pulses:
  * The connection line brightens temporarily
  * Both connected nodes glow brighter
  * Both connected nodes scale up slightly
- Pulse animations have smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions
- Pulse duration: 1.0 second
- New pulse triggered every 500ms

OPTIMIZATIONS:
------------
1. Buffer geometry for efficient rendering
2. Distance calculations cached during initialization
3. K-nearest neighbor logic to limit connection count
4. Additive blending for visually appealing overlaps
5. Local connections only, avoiding excessive distant connections

VISUAL QUALITY:
-------------
- Thin lines (linewidth: 1) with low opacity (0.03)
- Appropriate colors based on token type:
  * Fartcoin: Purple (#8A2BE2)
  * Goattoken: Orange (#FFA500)
- Bright pulse colors:
  * Fartcoin pulse: Bright purple (#B866FF)
  * Goattoken pulse: Bright orange (#FFB347)
- Node glow intensity increases during pulse animations

COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION:
------------------------------------
- Previous: All nodes potentially connected to all nodes of same type
- New: Each node connected to only 3-6 nearest neighbors
- Result: ~50% fewer connections while maintaining visual appeal
- Previous: Only lines pulsed during animations
- New: Both lines and connected nodes animate together

The implementation successfully creates a dynamic, visually engaging representation
of blockchain transactions with optimized performance and reduced visual clutter.
