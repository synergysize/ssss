Mouse Look Functionality Fix

Issue:
- Mouse look controls were not properly handling pointer lock
- Camera rotation was using a center-based approach rather than true mouse movement

Changes Made:
1. Enhanced mousemove event handler to use pointer lock when available
2. Added conditional logic to detect when pointer lock is active
3. Switched to using movementX/Y for more precise mouse look control
4. Maintained fallback to center-based calculation when pointer lock is not active
5. Increased sensitivity for better mouse look control

Now users can:
- Click the canvas to activate pointer lock
- Move the mouse to look around the 3D environment
- Experience smooth and responsive camera rotation

The mouse look functionality is now working correctly, providing an immersive 3D experience.
