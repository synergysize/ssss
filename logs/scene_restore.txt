## Scene Restoration Notes

### Issue Identified
The black screen bug was caused by two main issues:

1. Missing CSS positioning for the Three.js canvas. The canvas was being created but not positioned properly in the DOM, causing it to be invisible.

2. Z-index conflicts between the canvas and UI elements. The canvas needed to be behind the UI elements (fuel bar, controls) with a lower z-index.

### Changes Made
1. Added proper CSS positioning to the canvas element:
```css
canvas {
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

2. Ensured UI elements have higher z-index:
```css
#fuel-bar, #controls {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 10;
}
```

3. Validated that the canvas is correctly added to the DOM via `document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement)` in main.js.

4. Confirmed the animation loop is properly executing `renderer.render(scene, camera)`.

### Results
- The 3D scene now renders properly
- The green fuel bar appears correctly overlaid on the scene
- Movement controls are functional
- The scene elements are visible behind the UI elements
