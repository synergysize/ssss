Fuel Bar Display Fix

Issue:
- Fuel bar was not consistently visible
- Visual feedback for jetpack activation was minimal
- Z-index and color settings needed enhancement

Changes Made:
1. Ensured fuel bar is always visible with high z-index (1000)
2. Enhanced color settings with more vibrant colors based on fuel level
3. Added pulsing effect when jetpack is active for better visual feedback
4. Improved glow effects for active and inactive states
5. Made sure opacity settings properly reflect jetpack status

Now users can:
- Clearly see the fuel bar at all times
- Monitor fuel levels with intuitive color coding:
  * Green: High fuel level
  * Yellow: Medium fuel level
  * Red: Low fuel level
- Get immediate visual feedback when the jetpack is activated
- Experience a pulsing effect when the jetpack is in use

The fuel bar display is now fully functional and provides clear visual feedback for the jetpack system.
