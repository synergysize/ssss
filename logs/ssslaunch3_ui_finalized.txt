SSS Launch 3 UI Finalization Log
================================
Date: July 10, 2025

This log documents the UI polish and visual improvements made to the 3D Blockchain Wallet Visualizer application. The following tasks have been completed:

1. Increased Star Brightness:
   - Updated renderer.toneMappingExposure from 1.2 to 1.5 for enhanced brightness
   - Increased star opacity from 0.9 to 1.0 in createBrightStar function
   - Enhanced star gradient brightness in createStarTexture function
   - Stars and particles now appear significantly brighter and more visible

2. Disabled View Rotation When Mouse Leaves Screen:
   - Added stopRotating variable to control rotation behavior
   - Added event listeners for mouseleave and mouseenter to toggle the stopRotating flag
   - Modified the animation loop to respect the stopRotating flag
   - This prevents disorienting rotation when the mouse is not over the visualization

3. Removed Old Header Text:
   - Removed the "3D Blockchain Wallet Visualizer" header
   - Removed the "Interactive 3D visualization â€“ Desktop & Mobile" text
   - The UI is now cleaner with less distracting overlay text

4. Added Contract Address at Bottom Center:
   - Added a contract address display at the bottom center: "9BB6NFEcjBCtnNLFko2FqVQBq8HHM13kCyYcdQbgpump"
   - Styled with monospace font, proper positioning, and semi-transparent white color

5. Updated Movement Instruction:
   - Simplified controls message to just "WASD to move"
   - Removed references to mouse look, dragging, jetpack, etc.
   - Updated both HTML and JavaScript code to ensure consistent messaging

The final result provides a cleaner, more focused user experience with better visibility of the star field visualization and less intrusive UI elements.
