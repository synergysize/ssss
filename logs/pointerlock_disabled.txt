POINTER LOCK DISABLED CONFIRMATION
==============================

Date: July 9, 2025
Version: 31

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
-------------------
1. Removed all pointer lock functionality from the application
   - Overrode requestPointerLock method to do nothing
   - Overrode exitPointerLock method to do nothing
   - Removed all pointerlockchange event listeners

2. Ensured cursor remains visible at all times
   - Added "cursor: default !important;" CSS rule to canvas element
   - Verified cursor visibility during testing

3. Implemented hover-only look controls
   - Camera rotation now controlled by mouse position relative to screen center
   - No click required to look around
   - Camera responds to mouse movement without pointer lock

TESTING RESULTS:
--------------
✅ Cursor remains visible at all times, even when clicking on the canvas
✅ Clicking on the canvas does not engage pointer lock
✅ View rotates smoothly based on mouse hover position
✅ Cursor functions normally for all UI interactions

This implementation allows for a more user-friendly experience where the user maintains control of their cursor at all times while still being able to look around in the 3D environment by simply moving their mouse.
