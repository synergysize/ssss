WASD Movement Fix

Issue:
- Pointer lock functionality was disabled
- FlyControls needed proper initialization for WASD controls

Changes Made:
1. Restored pointer lock functionality by removing the override of requestPointerLock
2. Added event listener to activate pointer lock on canvas click
3. Added pointer lock change event listener for better control
4. Ensured controls.moveState is properly initialized
5. Fixed keyboard event handling for WASD keys

Now users can:
- Click on the canvas to activate pointer lock
- Use WASD keys to move around the 3D environment
- Movement works properly in all directions

The WASD movement system is now fully functional.
