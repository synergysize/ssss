================================

Node Statistics:
- Total Nodes: 2000
- Fartcoin Wallets: 1000 (Purple #8A2BE2)
- Goattoken Wallets: 1000 (Orange #FFA500)

Visualization Implementation:
- Files created:
  * dataLoader.js: CSV data loading
  * fractalPlacement.js: Golden ratio spiral node placement
  * tooltipHandler.js: Interactive wallet tooltips
  * shaders.js: Custom glow effects
  * main.js: Three.js visualization engine

Visualization Settings:
- Fractal Layout: Golden Ratio spiral with concentric shells and randomized jitter
- Node Sizing: Based on wallet token quantity (logarithmic scale)
- Custom Shaders: Implemented for enhanced glow effects
- Starfield: Dense cosmic background with 8,000+ star particles
- Controls: WASD movement with mouse look, ESC to pause

Visual Design:
- Purple glow for Fartcoin wallets
- Orange glow for Goattoken wallets
- Pulsing animation effect on node glow
- Non-uniform sprawling cosmic appearance
- Dynamic hover effects with size scaling

Verification:
- All 2000 nodes are rendered in 3D space
- Tooltips show wallet addresses on hover
- Hovering highlights nodes with scaling effect
- Nodes are colored according to token type
- Smooth rendering with frustum culling

Deployment:
- Code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/synergysize/ssss
- Deployed at: https://ssss-rouge-chi.vercel.app/
- Screenshot saved to: /screenshots/fractal_node_sprawl_complete.png
