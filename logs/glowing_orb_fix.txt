========================================
ENHANCED RADIANT CORE ORB IMPLEMENTATION
========================================

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
-----------------------

1. CORE ORB SPECIFICATIONS:
---------------------------
- Position: Center of visualization (0, 0, 0)
- Geometry: THREE.SphereGeometry with high resolution (64x64 segments)
- Radius: 200 units
- Material: MeshStandardMaterial (replaces MeshBasicMaterial)
- Rendering: Added to bloom layer for post-processing

2. MATERIAL PROPERTIES:
---------------------
- Base Color: 0xffffff (Pure white)
- Emissive: 0xffffff
- Emissive Intensity: 5.0 (dynamic: 3.0-7.0)
- Roughness: 0.2 (low for high reflectivity)
- Metalness: 1.0 (maximum for proper reflections)

3. POINT LIGHT ENHANCEMENT:
------------------------
- Type: THREE.PointLight
- Color: 0xffffff (Pure white)
- Base Intensity: 10.0 (dynamic: 5.0-15.0)
- Range: 4000 units (increased from 2000)
- Position: Centered at (0,0,0)

4. ADDITIONAL GLOW EFFECTS:
-------------------------
- Outer Glow Sphere: 300 units radius
- Custom Shader Material:
  * Increased base intensity: 2.0
  * Higher exponent in glow formula: 4.0 (was 3.0)
  * Increased opacity: 0.5 (was 0.4)
  * Improved depth calculation

5. POST-PROCESSING IMPLEMENTATION:
-------------------------------
- Added THREE.js EffectComposer
- Implemented UnrealBloomPass with parameters:
  * Strength: 1.5
  * Radius: 0.4
  * Threshold: 0.1
- Added core orb to special bloom layer (BLOOM_SCENE)
- Modified rendering loop to use composer.render()

6. ANIMATION ENHANCEMENTS:
-----------------------
- Synchronized pulsation across:
  * Point light intensity (10 ± 5)
  * Emissive intensity (5 ± 2)
  * Shader glow intensity (2.0 ± 0.8)
- Timing function: performance.now() * 0.0005
- Compatible with existing galaxy breathing effect

7. INTEGRATION IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------------------
- Updated window resize handler for proper post-processing scaling
- Added ambient light within the orb group
- Maintained core orb as focal point of visualization
- Ensured camera and controls remain unaffected

8. VISUAL OUTCOME:
---------------
- Three-dimensional sphere appearance
- Strong emissive glow from the core
- Light radiating outward onto nearby nodes
- Dynamic pulsation resembling a star or energy source
- Central focus point for the entire blockchain network

9. TECHNICAL BENEFITS:
-------------------
- Improved visual quality using industry-standard techniques
- Maintained good performance with optimized shader code
- Better visual hierarchy with the orb as the clear focal point
- More realistic lighting model and reflections
